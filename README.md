# codespace
### How to use
- Create a github codespace
- Run the init.sh file by opening a terminal and running ```bash init.sh```
- Open the code-workspace file ````File > Open Workspace from File > polybox.code-workspace``
- Walla! You now have polybox-server and polybox-client accessable and able to interact with eachover, without needing to run 2 codespaces!

### Additional Information
- This currently only works on linux, might add a windows version if I find a use for it
- You might get a message saying "This folder contains a workspace file 'polybox.code-workspace'. Do you want to open it? Learn more about workspace files." This will too, just make sure to run the init.sh file before doing that
